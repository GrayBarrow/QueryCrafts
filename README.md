# QueryCrafts Marketplace

QueryCrafts Marketplace is a digital marketplace for crafts people to buy and sell their creations through digital storefronts. 

## Installing and Running

The program is a single python script main.py which requires the packages rich and mysql-connector-python, both installable using pip as so:

```bash
pip install rich
```

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

The database was made and ran using MySQL on MySQL Workbench.

## Using and Instructions

The program is a CLI. Almost all interactions are by typing a number to select an option. Sometimes a word must be typed to select. Every action of every screen is explained in the footer. For further walkthrough, see the project report section on Application User Interface.

## Test Queries

The test queries are in this repo as a single sql file. As stated, I used MySQL to run everything, which means I ran everything on MySQL Workbench, if you would like to do the same.
